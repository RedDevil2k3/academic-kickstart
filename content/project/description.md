**<h2> Challenges faced:</h2>**

1. Initially the dataset was really big, thus it was taking time to read the entire dataset and then perform the calculation. The time taken was coming around 6-7 seconds, which is a terrible figure.

2. For a big dataset, with more than 100k entries, acquiring the posting lists is a big task.<br>

**<h2>Improvements:</h2>**

1. Elimination of stop words and lemmatizing existing words.

2. Passing the functions through a class, to make data retrieval from the dataset quicker, making search results faster.

3. Extraction of unique words while creating the word bank, thus reducing redundancy.
